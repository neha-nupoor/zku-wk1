Q3.4 - [Bonus] Give a novel idea on how we can apply ZK for Dao Tooling.
ZK proofs can be used to publish data of any activity without exposing which user performed the activity.


1.Anyone applying for any kind of special role based access control in a DAO (or to join a DAO), can do so, without divulging any kind of private information. 
Only necessary information can be accessed in the verifier contracts, and if the user has a valid proof they are provided access by a smart contract.

Example: If a user can prove they have a particular NFT, without giving any other information, they can be added to the DAO.

2. Another application of the same could be, a user can be given access to certain features of the DAO if they have a valid proof of activity/knowledge. 
This can be done without getting any information about the user. This can be applicable in games as well where DAOs are formed as a game plan.

Example: If a user can prove they have done X amount of campaigns/fights in a clan(DAO), if they choose to move to another clan(DAO), a smart contract can verify their proof, and provide them the same role/responsibility in the next clan, without divulging any other information about the user.
