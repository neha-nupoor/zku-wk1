SNARKs v/s STARKs:
Trusted setup is SNARK. No trust setting ceremony is needed in STARK.
Proof size in STARK is larger than SNARK, however, overall computation cost[amortized] for STARK lowers down in big txn batches.
STARK verification takes longer in principle because of larger proof sizes.
Lower onchain storage for SNARK.
STARKs have higher scalability than SNARKs because their provers are faster.
SNARKs require less gas than STARKs.
