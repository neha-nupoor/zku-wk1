Q3.3 - Give an idea of how we can apply ZK to create unique usage for NFTs.
We can mint unique tokens based NFTs where the proof is available on chain and metadata can be private. With zk-proofs we can create NFTs that act as a proof of existence, without giving out much details.
Any verifier can verify the proof, but does not get access to the data.
Ex: credit information. SSIN/Govt/Private identifiers. Medical records.
