Q: `Do we really need zero-knowledge proof for this? Can a publicly verifiable smart contract that computes Merkle root achieve the same? If so, give a scenario where Zero-Knowledge proofs like this might be useful. Are there any technologies implementing this type of proof? Elaborate in 100 words on how they work.`

Ans: TBD
